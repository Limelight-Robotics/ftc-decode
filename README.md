## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Android Studio**: Download and install Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the FTC Robot Controller repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Limelight-Robotics/ftc-decode.git
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project".
   - Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and select it.

4. **Sync the Project**: Once the project is open, Android Studio may prompt you to sync the project with Gradle files. Click "Sync Now" to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.

5. **Connect Your Robot Controller**: Follow the instructions in the [FTC documentation](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/) to connect your robot controller to your development environment.

6. **Start Coding**: You can now start modifying the code in the `/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode` folder to create your own robot control logic.
